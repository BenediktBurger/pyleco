# Release workflow

## PyPI

#. Draft a new release on github with a new tag (create on publish) in the style `vMajor.Minor.Patch`, where `Major`, `Minor`, and `Patch` are integers according to semnatic versioning
#. Use the autogenerated changelog to update `CHANGELOG.md` in main
#. Copy the modified changelog from the file to the github release draft
#. Release the new version on github
#. Approve the release run in the actions tab
#. Verify that the upload to PyPI succeeded


## Conda-forge

#. Do the PyPI release first
#. Rebase the `conda-forge-release` branch on the latest release
#. Create a tag with `vMajor.Minor.Patch-cf` at the head of that branch
#. Update the conda-forge repository with the version and checksum
