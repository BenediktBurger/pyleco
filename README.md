# PyLECO
Python reference implementation of the Laboratory Experiment COntrol (LECO) protocol (https://github.com/pymeasure/leco-protocol).

The [main branch](https://github.com/pymeasure/pyleco/tree/main) contains reviewed code, which does not yet contain all necessary modules and classes.
The most recent development is in the [development branch
](https://github.com/pymeasure/pyleco/tree/development), which might contain commits of a broken state.
The [stable-development branch](https://github.com/pymeasure/pyleco/tree/stable-development) contains a stable, working version of PyLECO.
Follow that branch to have always working code (as far as possible), but following the ongoing development.

Note: LECO is still under development, such that the code and API might change.
